/*

    Data Abstraction in c++ is method of hiding the implementation details or internal details
    and showing only the result i.e representing only the essetial detials

    * Example 
      Our Phones allows us to call , text, click photos, shoot videos without showing us the inside details 
      how its work internally
      Thus we can say, Phone hides the implementation detials

    * Example
      C++ also offer Data Abstraction , Like we pow(), different in built function which don't show the working
      or don't show the algo 
    
    In c++ we can implement class using private and public memebers then it is an example of Data Abstraction

    * Data Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:
       # Abstraction using classes
       # Abstraction in header files.

       Access Specifiers Implement Abstraction:

    Public specifier: When the members are declared as public, members can be accessed anywhere from the program.
    
    Private specifier: When the members are declared as private, members can only be accessed only by the member functions of the class.
