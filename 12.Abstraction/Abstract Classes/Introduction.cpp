/*
    Abstract classes are the way to achieve abstraction in C++
    Abstraction is a method of hiding the internail details and showing functionality

    It can be achieved in two ways:
    1--Abstract Class and
    2--Interfaces

    Both can have abstract methods which are necessary for abstraction
