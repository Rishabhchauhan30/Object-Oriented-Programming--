# What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.
## Why OOP
Object Oriented Programming has a capability of programming/coding (more precisely, MODELLING) any(most of) real world scenarios. Note* C++ is not purely object oriented, JAVA is a purely object oriented programming language
