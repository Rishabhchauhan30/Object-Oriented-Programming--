# Object-Oriented-Programming--
This repo contains description of object oriented concepts with description explaining some of the vital attributes of Object Oriented Programming.
# What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.
## Why OOP
Object Oriented Programming has a capability of programming/coding (more precisely, MODELLING) any(most of) real world scenarios. Note* C++ is not purely object oriented, JAVA is a purely object oriented programming language
# Major advantages of OOP
* Improved software-development productivity:--- Object-oriented programming is
modular, as it provides separation of duties in object-based program development. It
is also extensible, as objects can be extended to include new attributes and
behaviors. Objects can also be reused within an across applications. Because of
these three factors – modularity, extensibility, and reusability – object-oriented
programming provides improved software-development productivity over traditional
procedure-based programming techniques.
* Improved software maintainability:--- For the reasons mentioned above, objectoriented software is also easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the
system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale
changes.
* Faster development:--- Reuse enables faster development. Object-oriented
programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed
during projects is also reusable in future projects.
* Lower cost of development:--- The reuse of software also lowers the cost of
development. Typically, more effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and
design, which lowers the overall cost of development.
* Higher-quality software:--- Faster development of software and lower cost of
development allows more time and resources to be used in the verification of the
software. Although quality is dependent upon the experience of the teams, objectoriented programming tends to result in higher-quality software.
