/*
#   A virtual function is not used for performing any task. It only serves as a placeholder.

#   When the function has no definition, such function is known as "do-nothing" function.

#   The "do-nothing" function is known as a pure virtual function. 
    A pure virtual function is a function declared in the base class that has no definition relative to the base 
    class.

#   A class containing the pure virtual function cannot be used to declare the objects of its own, 
    such classes are known as abstract base classes.

#   The main objective of the base class is to provide the traits to the derived classes and
     to create the base pointer used for achieving the runtime polymorphism.

    * Pure virtual function can be defined as:

    * virtual void display() = 0;
